Hit 'Esc' to dismiss the dock.  \n\n*Note:* This package is a fork of the original \"save-commands\" package created by Jason Hunt (JsonHunt) that can be found [here](https://github.com/JsonHunt/save-commands).\n\nUpdates have been made to make it more user friendly and work with Atom's new dock system.\n\n### How to use\n\nCreate save-commands.json file in your project's root folder\nCreate one entry for each command you wish to run, and assign it to a glob like this:  \nglob : command {parameter}\n\nHere is an example of save-commands.json file\n```\n{\n\t\"commands\": [\n\t\t\"*.coffee : coffee -c {relFullPath}\",\n\t\t\"src/**/*.coffee : coffee -c -o dist{relPathNoRoot} {relFullPath}\",\n\t\t\"src/**/client/**/*.coffee : gulp browserify\",\n\t\t\"src/client/**/*.jade   : jade -P {relPath}{filename} -o dist{relPathNoRoot}\",\n\t\t\"src/client/**/*.jade   : gulp createTemplateCache\",\n\t\t\"src/server/**/*.jade : copy {relPath}{filename} dist{relPathNoRoot}\",\n\t\t\"src/**/*.styl   : gulp compileStylus\",\n\t\t\"src/**/*-spec.coffee : mocha src{relPathNoRoot}{name}.coffee --compilers coffee:coffee-script/register\",\n\t\t\"src/**/*.coffee : gulp runSpec --file=src{relPathNoRoot}{name}-spec.coffee --require coffee-script/register --compilers coffee:coffee-script/register\"\n\t]\n}\n```\nYou can create multiple save-commands.json files in various folders. The package will navigate file system tree\n(starting with the folder where saved file is located) until it finds a config file. That folder will also\nbe used as current working directory for commands\n\nIf you get errors when saving a file, double check your save-commands.json file to make sure it is formatted properly. The package will warn you if the config file is malformed.\n\n### Available parameters:  \n- absPath: absolute path of the saved file (without file name)  \n- relPath: relative path of the saved file (without file name)  \n- relFullPath: like relPath but with filename\n- relPathNoRoot: relative path without top folder  \n- filename: file name and extension  \n- name: file name without extension  \n- ext: file extension  \n- sep: os specific path separator\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"save-commands-plus@0.9.3","_shasum":"951fa890276fadb8270ef6b7653857a70d95470a","_resolved":"file:../d-117815-39467-93iczp.msse64j9k9/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117815-39467-93iczp.msse64j9k9/package.tgz"}
