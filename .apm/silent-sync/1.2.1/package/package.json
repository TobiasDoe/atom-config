With minimal setup, it automates the uploading process of working with a remote server.\n\n*Warning: this plugin is not yet compatible with **windows**, please check back in a week or two as it's under active development :smile:. (Of course, any help is greatly appreciated!)*\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\napm install silent-sync\n```\n\n## Features\n\n* Run your project both locally and on a remote environment through automatic uploading.\n* A nice little status bar widget<br />\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ben-z/Silent-Sync/master/Statusbar.gif\" width=\"300px\"/>\n\n## Settings\n\n####Through atom's settings panel\n* `Use configuration file`: Use `silent-sync.json` instead of the settings panel, recommended for individual projects. See documentation for more details.\n* `Missing configuration file notification`: When `Use configuration file` is selected, notify if `silent-sync.json` is missing.\n* `Enabled`: Only works when `Use configuration file` is off. Enable Silent Sync for your project.\n* `Host`: The SSH host. eg. somedomain.com\n* `Username`: The SSH username. eg. someone **Note:** authentication can only be done through an SSH key. [Here's a nice tutorial about it.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server)\n* `Remote Directory`: The absolute path of the remote server (without the backslash). eg. `/home/someone/Projects/myproject`.\n* `Excluded files`: An `array` of excluded files, relative to project root. (with first backslash, separated by commas) eg. `/node_modules, /someDir, /someSubDir`.\n* `Included files`: Included files (that are excluded above, eg. subdirectories/files of excluded), same format as the excluded.\n* `Delete Remote Files`: Remove any remote files that aren't present locally.\n* `Flags`: Custom flags for Rsync, defaults to 'avz'. A list of flags can be found [here](Options Summary).\n\n####Using `silent-sync.json` (Recommended)\nusing a configuration file has the benefit of having a unique configuration for each project.\n\nEnable `Use configuration file` in atom's settings panel and add a `silent-sync.json` to your project root.\n\nexample `silent-sync.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"host\": \"somedomain.com\",\n  \"port\": 22,\n  \"username\": \"someone\",\n  \"remoteDir\": \"/home/someone/Projects/myproject\",\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"/someDir\"\n  ],\n  \"include\": [\n    \"/someDir/something\"\n  ],\n  \"deleteRemoteFiles\":true,\n  \"rsyncFlags\": \"avz\"\n}\n\n```\n\nAfter modifying the settings, restart the plugin by toggling it twice with `ctrl-alt-s` or using the menu to see the change take effect.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nError | Possible Reasons\n:---------:|:--------------\nCode `255` | Cannot connect to server. 1. Server is down. 2. Key file does not match. 3. Host is not trusted (try to `ssh [YOUR_HOST]` in terminal and try again.)\nAlways displaying `SilentSync: Syncing` | Large projects can take a bit of time to sync. If it takes way too long, please create an issue with the steps to reproduce the problem.\n\nNote: This is my first [atom.io](https://atom.io/) plugin, please feel free to send [pull requests](https://github.com/ben-z/Silent-Sync/pulls) or report [issues and bugs](https://github.com/ben-z/Silent-Sync/issues)!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"silent-sync@1.2.1","_shasum":"11cc2620d683fae62cd6b11ed14e5144fe58c3ac","_resolved":"file:../d-1151121-4112-knhs2k/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151121-4112-knhs2k/package.tgz"}
