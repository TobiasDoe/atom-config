  "readme": "# jQuery\n\nThis is a collection of snippets for Atom, covering nearly all of the jQuery API. It was initially ported from my [TextMate bundle](https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-tmbundle) and then refactored to work better in the Atom environment.\n\n## Notes\n\n* Some methods such as `.find` and `.filter` have \"jq\" appended to the prefix. Although the prefix is less than ideal, it's necessary to avoid conflicts between the jQuery snippet and snippets in various JavaScript packages (without overriding those other snippets entirely). It shouldn't be a problem, since you don't have to type out the complete prefix before choosing a snippet. If there is a better way to avoid prefix conflicts, please let me know in a [github issue](https://github.com/kswedberg/atom-jquery/issues/new).\n* Contributions are always appreciated. Please fork this repo, make changes or additions, and send a pull request.\n\nThanks!\n",
